# Crackdown-Installer
Source code for Crackdown's auto-installer program.

This installer, upon being run, will download the latest Crackdown files and install them into the correct locations; the installer contains no Crackdown files itself and must download them at runtime. 

The total size of all Crackdown files (including those required for TOTAL CRACKDOWN) is somewhere between 1.5 to 2 GB, so it's necessary to split them up into separate download parts. For this reason, the installer was created to help users (especially those who are not technologically inclined) easily install Crackdown just by downloading the installer and running it. 

The installation can also be customized in the installer. 

Crackdown is 100% open-source, so you can find a list of all the repositories for these assets here:

3. [Optional] Customize your installation. Some content is optional, such as enemy reskins, map edits, and the TOTAL CRACKDOWN Player-side Overhaul; you can choose whether or not to install this optional content at your leisure. The installer can be used again later to modify your Crackdown mod and install or uninstall any of this content at will.
